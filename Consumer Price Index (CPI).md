# Consumer Price Index (CPI) Analysis Pipeline

## Overview
The **Consumer Price Index (CPI) Analysis Pipeline** is a data-driven project aimed at accurately computing and analyzing CPI trends. CPI is a crucial economic indicator that measures changes in the price level of a basket of consumer goods and services. This project ensures the accuracy of economic trend analysis by leveraging Python-based data pipelines.

ðŸš€ **Coming up soon! Stay tuned for updates.**

## Features
- **Automated CPI Computation**: Designed efficient data pipelines using Python to compute CPI with high accuracy.
- **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Utilized Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to analyze CPI trends and deliver actionable insights.
- **Optimized Data Storage**: Integrated MySQL for efficient data storage and retrieval, ensuring scalability and performance.
- **Scalability & Efficiency**: Implemented optimized queries and indexing in MySQL for enhanced data processing speed.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries & Tools**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Database**: MySQL

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection**: Collects raw price data from various sources.
2. **Data Processing**: Cleans and processes data to compute the CPI index.
3. **Storage**: Stores processed data in MySQL for efficient retrieval.
4. **Analysis & Visualization**: Uses Pandas and Matplotlib to generate insights and trends.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cpi-analysis.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib mysql-connector-python
   ```
3. Set up MySQL database and configure connection settings in the script.
4. Run the script to compute and analyze CPI:
   ```bash
   python cpi_analysis.py
   ```

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with real-time data sources (e.g., APIs).
- Advanced forecasting models using machine learning.
- Interactive dashboards for CPI trend visualization.
