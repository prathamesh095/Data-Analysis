## üìñ Project Overview

This repository presents a comprehensive data analytics project exploring the challenges and opportunities for legacy newspapers in transitioning to a digital-first model post-COVID-19. Using real-world-inspired datasets on print circulation, ad revenue, city digital readiness, and digital pilot programs, the analysis uncovers trends, correlations, and actionable insights to guide strategic decisions.

The project simulates a newspaper company's operations across Indian cities, evaluating print decline, digital adoption, and revenue optimization. Key themes include:
- **Declining print trends** amid rising digital penetration.
- **Ad revenue dynamics** across categories and currencies.
- **City-level disparities** in readiness and engagement.
- **ROI metrics** for digital vs. traditional channels.

Built with Python and Jupyter Notebook, this project is ideal for data enthusiasts, business analysts, or media strategists interested in media transformation.

## üéØ Project Objectives

The core goal is to answer 20+ strategic questions, such as:
- How has print circulation trended YoY, and which cities lead in net sales?
- What ad categories show resilience, and how does revenue correlate with circulation?
- Which cities have high digital readiness but low pilot engagement (untapped potential)?
- What's the transition index from print to digital users, and its YoY evolution?

These insights help identify growth levers, like targeting Tier 3 cities with Hindi editions or optimizing festive ad campaigns.

## üìä Dataset Overview

The project uses a star schema with dimensional and fact tables stored in a MySQL database (`legacy_newspaper`). Key datasets include:

| Table Name              | Description                          | Key Columns                          | Rows (Approx.) |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------|
| `dim_city`             | City demographics and tiers          | `city_id`, `city`, `state`, `tier`   | 500+          |
| `dim_ad_category`      | Ad categories and groups             | `ad_category_id`, `standard_ad_category`, `category_group` | 4             |
| `fact_print_sales`     | Monthly print sales and returns      | `edition_ID`, `Copies Sold`, `Net_Circulation`, `date` | 36,000+       |
| `fact_ad_revenue`      | Quarterly ad revenue by category     | `edition_id`, `ad_category`, `ad_revenue`, `quarter`, `currency` | 20,000+       |
| `fact_city_readiness`  | Quarterly city metrics (literacy, penetration) | `city_id`, `literacy_rate`, `smartphone_penetration`, `quarter` | 24,000+       |
| `fact_digital_pilot`   | Digital pilot metrics (costs, engagement) | `city_id`, `platform`, `users_reached`, `avg_bounce_rate` | 10,000+       |

**Data Generation:** The notebook includes scripts to generate 500+ synthetic cities and 10k+ entries for scalability. Real data can be substituted via CSV imports.
