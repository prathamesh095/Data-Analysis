A **portfolio-ready, analytics-focused Jupyter Notebook** delivering a **deep exploratory analysis of Electric Vehicle (EV) data**.  
This notebook follows a **real-world data analytics workflow** — from data ingestion and cleaning to exploratory analysis, visualization, and insight generation — aligned with **industry standards used in sustainability, mobility, and policy analytics**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To help **analysts, researchers, and sustainability stakeholders**:

- Understand **EV adoption trends** across years and regions  
- Compare **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV)** vs **Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV)**  
- Identify **top manufacturers and popular EV models**  
- Analyze **electric driving range improvements**  
- Study the **impact of clean fuel policy eligibility**  
- Generate **clear, data-driven insights** using exploratory analysis  

---

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes structured information on electric vehicles, such as:

- Vehicle make and model  
- Model year  
- Electric vehicle type (BEV / PHEV)  
- Electric range (miles)  
- Geographic attributes (state, county, city)  
- CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) eligibility  
- Vehicle identifiers (VIN)  

The structure closely resembles **public EV registration and transportation datasets** used by government agencies and research institutions.
