# Electric Vehicle Market & Consumer Insights Analysis (USA)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project provides a detailed analysis of the electric vehicle (EV) market in the United States, covering key aspects such as consumer adoption trends, infrastructure expansion, financial implications, and policy influences. By leveraging real-world data, this study delivers data-driven insights to support strategic decision-making and market growth within the U.S. EV sector.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify the most popular EV models and manufacturers in the U.S.
- Analyze EV adoption trends across various geographic regions (county, city, state, postal code).
- Examine the distribution of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) versus Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).
- Evaluate the impact of federal and state policies, incentives, and tax credits on EV sales and adoption.
- Assess infrastructure requirements, including charging station distribution and utility partnerships.
- Investigate financial aspects such as MSRP variations and the effect of Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility.

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Seattle leads in EV adoption**, with over 35,000 registered EVs.
- **BEVs dominate the U.S. market** (79.1%), while PHEVs represent 20.9%.
- **Tesla is the market leader**, with Model 3 being the most widely adopted EV.
- **Regions with a well-developed charging infrastructure** show higher BEV penetration rates.
- **CAFV-eligible vehicles experience higher adoption** due to U.S. federal and state government incentives and tax benefits.

## U.S.A. Policy & Infrastructure Impact

- Federal and state tax credits significantly influence EV adoption rates.
- The availability of charging stations varies across states, affecting regional adoption trends.
- Utilities play a crucial role in supporting EV infrastructure expansion.
