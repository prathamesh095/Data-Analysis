    "- **Higher EV Adoption with Incentives:** Counties with strong **local policies** or **financial incentives** show significantly **higher EV adoption rates**, even at lower price ranges.\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "The data suggests that **local policies, rebates, and incentives** significantly impact EV adoption, particularly in counties with strong government support. Future adoption strategies should focus on **reducing costs and expanding incentives** to encourage wider adoption.\n"
