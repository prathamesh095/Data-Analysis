# 🎯 Customer Segmentation Using Machine Learning

## 📝 Project Overview
Customer segmentation is a crucial marketing strategy that divides a customer base into groups of individuals that share similar characteristics.  
In this project, I built a **machine learning model** to cluster customers based on their demographics and spending habits, enabling businesses to better target and personalize their marketing strategies.

## 🚀 Key Highlights
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
  - Handled missing values using **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputer** to ensure data quality.

- 📈 **Clustering with KMeans**  
  - Applied the **KMeans Clustering Algorithm** to identify natural groupings in customer data.

- 🧮 **Evaluation Metrics**  
  - Optimized the number of clusters using the **Silhouette Score** to ensure meaningful segmentation.

- 🧠 **Dimensionality Reduction**  
  - Used **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce data dimensions for easier visualization.

- 📊 **Data Visualization**  
  - Plotted clusters interactively using **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**, and **Plotly** for deeper insight.

## 🔍 Workflow
1. **Load and explore** the dataset.
2. **Handle missing values** and preprocess the data.
3. **Apply KMeans clustering** and determine optimal clusters.
4. **Evaluate performance** using the Silhouette Score.
5. **Visualize the clusters** after reducing dimensions via PCA.

## 📊 Results
- Identified distinct customer groups based on spending behavior and demographics.
- Achieved well-separated and meaningful clusters, validated through silhouette analysis.
- Generated actionable insights that can drive targeted marketing campaigns.
